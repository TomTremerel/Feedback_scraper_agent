One of those no brainer, shut-up-and-take-my-money products that solved a real need inside my app. It‘s such a great way to keep customers informed inside your app and offers easy ways to collect feedback with voting and comments — without the huge feature bloat of something like a Drift or Intercom.",

With Beamer I'm saving tons of time on this and putting those new features right on my customers's noses which is great for my to show my SAAS customers our progression.",

There are alternatives and some of them are cheaper but I got this on AppSumo as a lifetime deal so how could I pass this up. We use it for our SaaS platform and it makes it a lot easier to get updates out there and drive users where you want for them to get more info. I find this works really well with SupportHero. The tandem of the two gets us almost all of what we need in terms of simple push communication and documentation.",
